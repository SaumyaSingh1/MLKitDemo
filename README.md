This is a sample project of an app that uses Firebase's MLKit to classify an image in 3 different ways. 

## Branches
Each branch shows the implementation of a differnt model.

Feel free to explore it with and without the tutorial and bolgposts:

   *  **0.start** - the starting code with basic UI
   *  **1.run_local_model** - implementation with local (on device) MLKit model
   *  **2.run_cloud_model** - implementation with cloud based MLKit model 
   *  **3.run_custom_model** - implementation with TensorflowLite custom model (managed by MLKit)

## How to get started?

You'd have to clone the repository and adding Firebase to it.

Everything is explained at this turorial: [Tutorial - Classify an image with MLKit for Android](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/09/25/a-strawberry-or-not-classify-an-image-with-mlkit-for-android/)
